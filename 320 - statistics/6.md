# Continuous Probability Distributions

## Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is defined by the probability density function:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2} $$

where:   
 - $f(x)$ is the probability density function
 - $x$ is the random variable
 - $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution
 - $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the distribution
 - $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828)
 - $\pi$ is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159
