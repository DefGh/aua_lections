# EXAMPLE 3
# Sara is a salesperson for Cameraâ€™s Etc., which is a retailer for high-end digital cameras.
# Historically, Sara has averaged selling 2.1 extended warranties per day for cameras that she sells.
# Assume the number of camera warranties that Sara sells per day follows the Poisson distribution.
# a. What is the probability that Sara will sell five extended warranties tomorrow?
# b. What is the probability that Sara will not sell an extended warranty tomorrow?
# c. What is the probability that Sara will sell more than two extended warranties tomorrow?
# d. What is the standard deviation for this distribution?
