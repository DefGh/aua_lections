# Exponential probability

## Exponential probability density function 

$$ f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x} $$

where:   
 - $f(x)$ is the probability density function
 - $x$ is the value of the random variable
 - $\lambda$ is the average number of successes that occur in a specified region

The mean $\mu = \frac{1}{\lambda}$

the parameter $\lambda$ influences both spread and shape of distribution.
Higher $\lambda$ lead to curve that declines more sharply, meaning more probability mass is concentrated near $0$ 

the mean $\mu$ shows the reverse -> the expected value of distribution.

as smaller mean implies a grated likelihood of smaller values. While larger mean corresponds to more dispersed values of $x$ 

$$ p(x \le a) = 1 - e^{-a\lambda} $$

### example (0 from book)

Suppose the average time between customer arrivals at the deli counter of a Piggly Wiggly grocery store (awesome name for a store) is 4 minutes. What is the probability that the next customer will arrive at the counter within the next 2 minutes? > Figure 6.23 shows the exponential distribution for the deli counter. We are looking for the shaded area under the curve labeled P1x ... 22.

// TODO: add the figure 

$\mu = 4$ 

$\lambda = \frac{1}{\mu} = \frac{1}{4}$

$$ p(x \le 2) = 1 - e^{-2 * \frac{1}{4} }= 1 - e^{\frac{-2}{4}} =  39 \% $$


### EXAMPLE 1
During lunch hour, customers arrive at a fast-food drive-through window, on average, every 2.5
minutes. Assume arrival time follows the exponential probability distribution.
What is the probability that the next customer will arrive:
1. within the next 2 minutes?
2. in more than 5 minutes?
3. between 1 and 4 minutes?

$ \mu = 2.5 $  $ \lambda = 1 \div 2.5 = 0.4 $

1. $p(x \le 2 ) = 1 - e^{-2 * 0,4 } = 55\%$  
2. $p(x > 5 ) =  1 -  p(x \le 5 ) =  e^{-5 * 0,4 } = 14\%$  
3. $p(1 < x < 4 ) = p( x < 4 ) - p(x < 1 ) = e^{-4 * 0.4} - e^{-0.4} = 47\% $
