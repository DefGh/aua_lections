# Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time. It is used for independent events which occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.


Probability Mass Function

The probability mass function (pmf) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete probability distribution, and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is discrete.

$$ P(x) = \frac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!} $$

where:   
 - $P(x)$ is the probability of getting exactly x successes
 - $x$ is the number of successes
 - $\lambda$ is the average number of successes that occur in a specified region
 - $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828)

## EXAMPLE 
> Sara is a salesperson for Cameraâ€™s Etc., which is a retailer for high-end digital cameras.
> Historically, Sara has averaged selling 2.1 extended warranties per day for cameras that she sells.
> Assume the number of camera warranties that Sara sells per day follows the Poisson distribution.
